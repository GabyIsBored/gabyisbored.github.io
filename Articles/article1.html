            <h2>1. Angular</h1>
            <h1>JavaScript Framework, One of the most powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript frameworks is Angular. Google operates this framework and is implemented to use for developing a Single Page Application (SPA). It extends the HTML into the application and interprets the attributes to perform data binding.</h2>

            <h2>Features</h1>
            <h3>Cross-Platform
                
            <h3>Progressive Web Apps: Modern web platform capabilities to deliver app-like experiences that are high performance, offline, and zero-step installation.
                 Native: Strategies from Cordova, Ionic, or NativeScript are used to build the native app.
                 Desktop: Desktop-installed apps across Mac, Windows, and Linux can be created using the same Angular methods like the web plus the ability to access native OS APIs.
                 Speed and Performance</h3>
                
            <h3>Code Generation: Angular turns templates into code that's highly optimized for JavaScript virtual machines, giving hand-written code benefits. 
                Universal: Serve the first view of Node.js, .NET, PHP, and other servers for near-instant rendering in just HTML and CSS. 
                 Code Splitting: With the new Component Router, angular apps load quickly, delivering automatic code-splitting. So users load the code required to render the view they request.
                 Productivity</h3>
                
            <h3>Templates: Create UI views with simple and powerful template syntax.
                Angular CLI: Command line tools: start building fast, add components and tests, then instantly deploy.
                IDEs: Get intelligent code completion, instant errors, and other feedback in popular editors and IDEs.
                Full Development Story </h3> 
                
            <h3>>Testing: Protractor makes your scenario tests run faster and in a stable manner.
                Animation: Create high-performance, complex choreographies, and animation timelines with very little code through Angular's intuitive API.
                Accessibility: Create accessible applications with ARIA-enabled components, developer guides, and built-in a11y test infrastructure.</h3>
            
            
            <h2>2. React</h1>
            
            <h1>Created by Facebook, the React framework has earned popularity within a short period. It is used to develop and operate the dynamic User Interface of the web pages with high incoming traffic. It makes the use of a virtual DOM, and hence, the integration of the same with any application is more straightforward.</h3>
            <img src="../assets/Pics/react-2.png" alt="">
            
            <h2>Features</h1>
    
            <h3>Declarative: Creates interactive and dynamic UI for websites and mobile applications. React updates efficiently and render the right components when data changes. Declarative views make the code readable and easy to debug.</h3>
    
            <h3>Virtual DOM: For every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object." It creates a virtual copy of the original DOM and is a representation of a DOM object</h3>
            
            <h3>Event handling: React has its fully compatible W3C object model event system created. It also provides a cross-browser interface to a native event, meaning no need to worry about incompatible event names and fields. React reduces memory head by as event system is implemented through event delegation and has a pool of event objects.</h3>
            
            <h3>JSX: JSX is a markup syntax that closely resembles HTML. JSX makes writing React components easier by making the syntax almost identical to the HTML injected into the web page.</h3>
    
            <h3>Performance: React uses one-way data binding with an application architecture called Flux controls. ReactJS helps update the View for the user and, Flux controls the application workflow. Virtual DOM adds advantages as it compares the new data with original DOM and updates the View automatically. </h3>
    
            <h3>React Native: React Native is a custom renderer for React; it uses native components instead of web components like React as building blocks. It also serves access to these platforms' features, apart from transforming React code to work on iOS and Android.</h3>
    
            <h3>Component-Based: In React, everything is a component of the web page divided into small components to create a view(or UIs). Every part of the application visuals would be wrapped inside a self-contained module known as a component. Components in ReactJS use to define the visuals and interactions in applications.</h3>
           
           <h2> 3. Node.js</h1>
            
            
            <h1>Node.js is a server-side JavaScript run-time environment, which works on cross platforms and is open-source. The framework is capable of driving asynchronous I/O with its event-driven architecture. It works in the JavaScript Runtime environment and shows JAVA's similar properties like threading, packaging, o forming loops.</h3>
    
            <img src="../assets/Pics/nodejs.png" alt="">
            <h2>Features:</h1>
    
            <h3>It is swift:
            The library of Node.js is fast when it comes to code execution, as it is built on the V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome></h3>
            
            <h3>I/O is asynchronous and Event-Driven:
                All the APIs are asynchronous, which means that its server does not wait for the API to come back with data. Here the server calls the APIs one by one and keeps moving to the next one while using a notification mechanism of Events to generate a response from the API, called previously. This makes it fast too. </h3>
            
            <h3>Single-threaded:
                Node.js, along with event looping, follows a single-threaded model.</h3>    
            
            <h3>Highly scalable:
                Node.js follows an event mechanism that makes it possible for the server to respond in a non-blocking manner, which eventually makes it scalable.</h3>
            
            <h3>No buffering:
                When it comes to uploading audio and video files, Node.js cuts down the processing time significantly. It does not buffer any data, and here the application gets out the data in chunks.</h3>
            
            <h3>Open source:
                Being open-source, Node.js's community has come up with several amazing models that can be used to add better capabilities to the Node.js applications.</h3>
            
            <h3>License:
                It has been released under MIT license.</h3>
